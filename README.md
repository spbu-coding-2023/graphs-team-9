# Graph visualization and analysis app
This app enables users to visualize and analyze graphs using gui.
Application supports modern (later 2006) and classic graph algorithms, allowing for analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Supported graphs: 
  - weighted or unweighted 
  - directed or undirected
- Saving and reading with SQLite, neo4j or in .svs file
- [High closeness centrality vertices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281414046_An_Extremely_Fast_Algorithm_for_Identifying_High_Closeness_Centrality_Vertices_in_Large-Scale_Networks)
